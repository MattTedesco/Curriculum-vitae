        <p><em>National Program Manager</em></p>
        <p>During my career and education, I have developed a passion for electric vehicles and sustainability. My belief is that battery technology combined with wind and solar can not only revolutionize the automotive industry but the world around us.
          These emerging technologies combined with the vast changes in the digital marketing landscape will have far-reaching implications on data analytics, data privacy, and data security. The data generated will also play a large role in artificial
          intelligence and machine learning as these technologies evolve at a rapid pace.<br><br>

          My career as a marketing leader has led me to the point where all of these things are merging together, and I am a thought leader I could not be more excited to guide businesses through the next 30 years of technological development. To stay as
          the forefront, I am constantly learning and expanding my education and skills in both business and digital marketing because the digital world is constantly evolving. <br><br>

          I completed my M.B.A. in Finance so that I have a robust knowledge of the financial markets, as well as a business P&L. I am also continually learning new skills such as HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, and soon Python, as well as enterprise data
          analytics tools like PowerBI. <br><br>

          I am truly looking forward to what the future may hold.</p></td>
